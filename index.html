            This paragraph is my opinion and my opinion alone. The rest is a factual account. I say this to avoid a 
            potential SLAPP suit or any other trickery this horrible company will try to damage me with. They have 
            acted not only in bad faith, but they have done so maliciously in my opinion. They have cost me over 
            $20 thousand dollars so far in legal fees and damages while I continue to jump through their hoops 
            to pay my rent on time. They have harassed me with notices. They had a police officer come to my 
            apartment. They have acted underhanded in many ways that I will describe in order to try to get me 
            evicted such as shutting down my ability to pay online so that they could forgo courts to try 
            to evict me for not paying rent. They have said that a drop box for delivering checks is not a 
            dropbox even though it clearly states in the lease that it is. They have refused to cash the 
            cashier's checks that I delivered to them causing 5 of them so far to get an automatic stop-pay 
            after 180 days. The credit union will not return that money as I don't have possession of the 
            checks. They have now mentioned suing me for back rent that they already have in cashier's checks 
            that they refuse to cash. They have damaged my reputation with this court record showing up when 
            I try to get a new place to live. They have caused me to miss over 40 hours of work dealing with 
            their litigious ways. This is all for an accident that I didn't even cause. Something that could 
            have been a ten minute conversation.The below account will go over in detail the misery this 
            company has put me through.

        <h2>Summary of Events</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                My friend, who I have known for 5 years, asked to stop by and borrow a tool. I agreed, not knowing 
                that he was planning on doing said work in my apartment. My friend is a US Army Veteran that served 
                for 7 years in a direct combat role. He did end up having an accidental discharge of his firearm. 
                It is a serious matter, but was later deemed by a court to be accidental and a fault of the weapon. 
                No one was hurt and 911 was called. Southwood Realty Village At Lake Wylie (the landlord) pressed 
                charges. We both offered to pay for any and all damages.
            </p>
            <p>Two days later, they placed a notice on my door telling me that they had revoked my right to possession 
                of the property. I had two weeks to move out before eviction. They gave me no chance to correct 
                the issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point I hired a lawyer for advice. Below is the letter the landlord was sent with 
                personal information redacted:
            </p>
            <code>
                This firm has been retained by &gt;client&lt; in response to your notice dated May 11, 2023, which attempts to unilaterally terminate his right to possession of the above-referenced apartment ("Premises"). My client is a good tenant and in
                compliance with all terms of his Lease, including Paragraph 14. While an unfortunate situation occurred on or about May 9, 2023 which resulted in a citation being issued &gt;friend&lt; for his conduct. It is my understanding that &gt;friend&lt; is, or was in our military, and also has a concealed weapons permit and thus has experience and training in the handling of firearms. My client did not handle or possess the firearm at issue and it was in &gt;friend&lt;'s possession the entire time. By all accounts, this was an accident on the part of &gt;friend&lt; that occurred despite his training and careful handling of the firearm. Immediately upon this accidental discharge occurring, my client ensured that 911 was contacted and ensured that no one was injured as a result. This isolated accident will never happen again.
                While Paragraph 14(A)(6) does address the discharge of firearms, the clause specificaly addresses a resident's prohibition of engaging in such conduct, and implies a restriction on the resident engaging in intentional conduct in violation of that paragraph. I've attached the citation referenced above which again reflects that my client was not the individual involved in the conduct or charged, and that &gt;friend&lt; was charged with negligent conduct, not intentional conduct. In this regard, I suggest that a common sensical approach must be taken, which is consistent with South Carolina law.
                South Carolina Courts have plainly outlined that "the landlord's right to terminate is not unlimited and that the court's decision to permit termination must be tempered by
                notions of equity and common sense." Kiriakides v. United Artists Commc'ns, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 276, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994). "Accordingly, we hold that a forfeiture for a trivial or immaterial breach of a commercial lease should not be enforced."
                Id. Equity and common sense will dictate that my client did not intentionally or willfully breach any lease provisions.
                South Carolina's "common sensical" approach and requirement of fundamental fairness is further outlined in the obligation of good faith in the enforcement of any rights as codified in South Carolina Code Annotated Section 27-40-220.
                Beyond the foregoing, however, South Carolina Code Annotated Section 27-40- 710 establishes an obligation on the landlord to provide tenants with an opportunity to cure any alleged default, assuming a default has been demonstrated. Any attempts to have tenants waive this right is unenforceable. See South Carolina Code Annotated Section 27- 40-330(a)(1). These provisions are designed to ensure that accidental or unintentional "violations" or "defaults" do not give rise to a loss of possession, as they are allowed to be cured. As outlined above, as soon as the accidental discharge occurred, my client undertook steps to ensure 911 was contacted and that no one had been injured. My client addressed the situation responsibly and immediately.
                My client is a good tenant and has every intention of complying with every term and condition of the lease, as he always has. He enjoys the property and does not want to get into a legal dispute, but as noted herein, he stands on solid legal ground. I am happy to discuss any of the foregoing with your property management team or legal counsel. For these legal reasons, please understand that my client disagrees with your suggestion that he violated any term of his lease and has no intention of vacating the premises. I thank you for taking the time to review the aforementioned legal authorities. After doing so, I'm sure that you will come to the same conclusion that I have and will allow my client to remain in possession of the space and will not pursue eviction as it is unwarranted. Should you have any questions, or would like to discuss this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.

        <h2>Details and Legal Actions</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After this letter, they continued to deliver to me, rather than my attorney, 5 more letters of termination of right to possess with various dates cited.</p>
            <p>Also during this time, they blocked my ability to pay rent online, forcing me to travel 30 minutes away to a credit union to get cashier's checks each month. They refused to take the first rent check, following me outside to argue with me.</p>

            </div>
            <p>My friend was found “Not Guilty”.</p>
            <p>They then filed for eviction and had a police office come to my door to notify me that I was being evicted, rather than send it to my attorney and legal counsel.</p>
            <p>They are evicting me for criminal activity. My attorney showed cause that they should not be able to and the judge agreed that it should go to trial.</p>
            <p>I put the second and third rent check in the dropbox and they refused to take it out, letting them accumulate in the drop box where anyone could take them for months.</p>
            <p>See picture:</p>
            <img src="2023-09-04 17.29.37.jpg" alt="Image of dropbox">
            <p>Eventually, I called them and was informed the drop box you see was not a drop box. That they do not have a drop box. It says clearly in my lease:</p>
            <code>
                "Use of Overnight or "Drop" Boxes. For the purposes of this Lease, including the purpose of assessing late fees pursuant to Paragraph 1(C),
                Resident agrees that any notice or payment delivered by Resident to an after-hours "drop box" located on the exterior of Lessor's management office
                shall be deemed received at the time the management office re-opens for business, not before".
            </code>

                </audio>
            </div>
            <p>They then filed a motion for summary judgement against me. Trying once again to skip due process and a trial. The judge denied them this motion.</p>
            <p>They have refused to cash the 11 cashier's checks that I delivered to them causing 5 of them so far to have an automatic stop-pay for being more than 6 months old.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>To make a long story short, they have continued to drag this along for over a year now. I have spent over $20k fighting on my defense. I have had to take 48 hours off work so far to get checks and go to court.</p>
            <p>I have offered a reasonable settlement to get past this only involving them giving me the checks back that are over 180 days old with me leaving before my lease is done. That would not even cover my legal fees defending myself at this point.</p>
            <p>They are simply using the fact that they have more money to maliciously damage me.</p>
